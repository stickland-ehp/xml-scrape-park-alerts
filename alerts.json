QPWS continue to receive reports of these canisters washing up on beaches at K&rsquo;gari, Mulgumpin (Moreton Island) and Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island).</p> <p><strong>The canisters contain a rat poison known as &lsquo;aluminium phosphide&rsquo;, a white to grey solid which is hazardous to humans.</strong></p> <p>When the canister is opened, the powder reacts with moisture in the air to release phosphine gas, which is also highly toxic to humans. The gas has a strong odour that can smell like garlic, rotting fish or urine, but it can quickly dull the sense of smell.</p> <p>Exposure can cause symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, dizziness, tightness of the chest, diarrhoea, fluid in the lungs, liver/kidney damage, and in severe cases death.</p> <p>The gas is also flammable and can spontaneously ignite causing burns or small explosions.</p> <p>The canisters are silver in colour and approximately 22 centimetres tall. They have a tapered top with a screw in lid. &nbsp;Images of the canisters are available <a href=\"https://volunteerfirefighters.org.au/safety-advice-possible-toxic-canisters-washed-up-on-our-beaches\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Canisters should not&nbsp;<strong>be moved or opened, and any sightings should be reported to emergency services on Triple Zero (000).</strong></strong></p>",
