Visitors and residents should close windows and doors and keep medications close by if suffering from a respiratory illness.</p> <p>For more information, please call Eurong office of QPWS on (07) 4127 9128, Dundubara office of QPWS on (07) 4127 9138 or Waddy Point office of QPWS on (07) 14279190.</p> <p>Please observe all signage, barriers and directions from rangers and do not enter closed areas.</p> <p><strong>Your safety is our concern, but your responsibility.</strong></p> <p>Stay up-to-date with <a href=\"https://www.fire.qld.gov.au/Current-Incidents\">Current bushfire warnings and incidents</a> from Queensland Fire Department (QFD).</p>",
