Visit <a href=\"https://book.parks.qld.gov.au/thorsborne-trail-pass-24-july-2025-onwards#/tours/148080\">Thorsborne Trail bookings</a> to familiarise yourself with the process well before the permit release, as permits for the peak hiking season (May-September) will sell out within an hour of the release. Be prepared with backup dates if you are initially unsuccessful.</p> <p>Visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.qld.gov.au/ThorsborneTrailHikingSeasons\">qld.gov.au/ThorsborneTrailHikingSeasons</a>&nbsp;for information and updates about the changes including the camping permit release schedule. This page contains FAQs and information about how to be best prepared for the permit release.</p> <p>To help spread hiker numbers more evenly across the trail and camping areas and avoid crowding, QPWS is also trialling a change from 40 people at any one time on the trail, to 12 people starting the trail each day. This will maintain similar usage consistent with Visitor Strategy limits.</p> <p>The 2026 hiking season is 1 March-31 December. The standard annual seasonal closure period 1 January-28 February will remain in place to manage the increased risk of unsafe conditions at this time of year.</p>",

This is when turtles will lay their eggs, and hatchlings are most likely to be emerging. Exercise caution and look out for turtles and turtle hatchlings when traversing on the beach.</li> <li>If turtles are making their way across the beach - slow down, stop and wait for the turtles to reach the ocean or the dunes.&nbsp;On-the-spot fines apply to visitors disturbing turtle hatchlings or turtle nests.</li> <li>Driving over vegetated dunes is dangerous and prohibited. It is damaging to the environment and can impact turtle nests, on-the-spot fines apply.</li> </ul> <p><strong>&lsquo;Cut the glow to help turtles go&rsquo;.</strong> Artificial lights can affect a turtle&rsquo;s ability to see the natural horizon over the ocean. Hatchlings can become disoriented, veer from their natural path and head towards the artificial light. When camping during the nesting season you can help cut the glow of lights affecting beaches by switching off unnecessary lights on the beach after 7.30pm.</p> <p>Observe all signage, barriers and directions from rangers.</p> <p>To report marine animal strandings (of sick, injured or dead turtles, dolphin, dugongs or whales) call the&nbsp;<strong>1300&nbsp;130&nbsp;372.</strong></p> <p>For your safety please avoid interaction with the wildlife.</p>",

Keep to the hard sand well below the high tide line to avoid making wheel ruts that create barriers to hatchling movement down the beach.</li> <li>Avoid driving on the beach at night. This is when turtles will lay their eggs, and hatchlings are most likely to be emerging. Exercise caution and look out for turtles and turtle hatchlings when traversing on the beach.</li> <li>If turtles are making their way across the beach - slow down, stop and wait for the turtles to reach the ocean or the dunes. On-the-spot fines apply to visitors disturbing turtle hatchlings or turtle nests.</li> <li>Driving over vegetated dunes is dangerous and prohibited.

      "details": "<p>During ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred, storm surges and swell eroded the eastern-facing beaches of Inskip Peninsula, and caused loss of sand, destabilisation of the dunes and loss of existing campground border fencing.</p> <p>A team of geotechnical erosion experts was engaged to investigate the impacts of cyclone events at the Inskip Peninsula Recreation Area and to provide technical advice regarding site safety. Based on the findings and recommendations from the geotechnical assessment, the camping area boundaries will be realigned to establish a 20-metre retrogression buffer<strong> zone</strong> landward of the current treeline.</p> <p>This boundary realignment is necessary due to ongoing coastal erosion, nearshore landslide risk, and damage sustained to existing infrastructure. The revised layout will enhance visitor safety by reducing exposure to unstable shoreline areas and future erosion hazards.&nbsp;</p> <p>Installation of the new fencing will take place between 10 November and 05 December 2025 (weather and logistics permitting) as the three impacted campgrounds will be closed during this time for pre-scheduled maintenance closures. The following camping areas will be closed for construction during this period:</p> <ul> <li>CLOSED: M.V. Beagle&nbsp;(10-16 November 2025 inclusive)</li> <li>CLOSED: M.V. Sarawak&nbsp;(17 &ndash; 27 November 2025 inclusive)&nbsp;</li> <li>PARTIALLY CLOSED: Sarawak West&nbsp;(05 November &ndash; 05 December 2025 inclusive). A small section of camping area is barriered off for construction purposes.</li> </ul> <p>Observe all signage, barriers and directions from rangers, and do not enter closed areas.</p> <p>All permits for the closed areas are suspended for the duration of the closure (not including Sarawak West). Alternate camping areas are available at Inskip Peninsula camping area for the duration of the closures.</p> <p>Apply for a camping permit refund online at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.qld.gov.au/camping\">www.qld.gov.au/camping</a>.
