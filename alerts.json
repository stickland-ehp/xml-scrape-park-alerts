This is when turtles will lay their eggs, and hatchlings are most likely to be emerging. Exercise caution and look out for turtles and turtle hatchlings when traversing on the beach.</li> <li>If turtles are making their way across the beach - slow down, stop and wait for the turtles to reach the ocean or the dunes.&nbsp;On-the-spot fines apply to visitors disturbing turtle hatchlings or turtle nests.</li> <li>Driving over vegetated dunes is dangerous and prohibited. It is damaging to the environment and can impact turtle nests, on-the-spot fines apply.</li> </ul> <p><strong>&lsquo;Cut the glow to help turtles go&rsquo;.</strong> Artificial lights can affect a turtle&rsquo;s ability to see the natural horizon over the ocean. Hatchlings can become disoriented, veer from their natural path and head towards the artificial light. When camping during the nesting season you can help cut the glow of lights affecting beaches by switching off unnecessary lights on the beach after 7.30pm.</p> <p>Observe all signage, barriers and directions from rangers.</p> <p>To report marine animal strandings (of sick, injured or dead turtles, dolphin, dugongs or whales) call the&nbsp;<strong>1300&nbsp;130&nbsp;372.</strong></p> <p>For your safety please avoid interaction with the wildlife.</p>",

Keep to the hard sand well below the high tide line to avoid making wheel ruts that create barriers to hatchling movement down the beach.</li> <li>Avoid driving on the beach at night. This is when turtles will lay their eggs, and hatchlings are most likely to be emerging. Exercise caution and look out for turtles and turtle hatchlings when traversing on the beach.</li> <li>If turtles are making their way across the beach - slow down, stop and wait for the turtles to reach the ocean or the dunes. On-the-spot fines apply to visitors disturbing turtle hatchlings or turtle nests.</li> <li>Driving over vegetated dunes is dangerous and prohibited. It is damaging to the environment and can impact turtle nests, on-the-spot fines apply.</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://parks.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/162802/mrcp-lights-marine-turtles.pdf\"><strong>&lsquo;</strong><strong>Cut the Glow</strong></a><strong> to help turtles go&rsquo;.</strong> Artificial lights can affect a turtle&rsquo;s ability to see the natural horizon over the ocean.

Based on the findings and recommendations from the geotechnical assessment, the camping area boundaries will be realigned to establish a 20-metre retrogression buffer<strong> </strong>zone landward of the current treeline.</p> <p>This boundary realignment is necessary due to ongoing coastal erosion, nearshore landslide risk, and damage sustained to existing infrastructure. The revised layout will enhance visitor safety by reducing exposure to unstable shoreline areas and future erosion hazards. The following changes apply:</p> <p><strong>M.V. SARAWAK:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Beachfront campsites and the former access track are no longer accessible, including the area known as &ldquo;Millionaire&rsquo;s Row&rdquo;.&nbsp;This location, previously favoured by campers for its open access to solar, firmer surface, and beach proximity, is now closed.</li> <li>Caravans are not suitable in the M.V. Sarawak camping area due to narrow access tracks and stands of cypress and oak trees.</li> <li>When entering M.V. Sarawak, follow all signage and take the first left access track.</li> <li>Do not proceed straight ahead&mdash;this route is now a dead end.</li> </ul> <p><strong>M.V. BEAGLE:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Beachfront campsites and the former beachfront access track are no longer accessible.</li> <li>Caravans are not suitable in the M.V.

Beagle, follow the signage and take the first left access track.</li> <li>Do not proceed straight ahead&mdash;this route is now a dead end.</li> </ul> <p><strong>M.V. NATONE:</strong></p> <ul> <li>The Natone entrance track and eastern low lying camping areas are no longger accessible. Entry and exit to Natone is now through the former exit.</li> <li>Caravans are not suitable in the M.V. Natone camping area due&nbsp;to narrow access tracks, soft sand and inability to turn around.</li> <li>Camping in Natone is suitable to smaller tents and high clearance 4WD only.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><strong>SS Dorrigo and Sarawak West remain the only Inskip camping areas suitable for caravans, requiring a high-clearance caravan towed by a high-clearance 4WD.</strong></p> <p>Observe all signage, barriers and directions from rangers, and do not enter closed areas.</p> <p>Apply for a camping permit refund online at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.qld.gov.au/camping\">www.qld.gov.au/camping</a>.

An increase in dingo-human interactions is expected during the dispersal season.</p> <p>This is a particularly important time for juvenile dingoes (wongari) to test their strength and learn essential survival skills, and to avoid habituation towards people.
