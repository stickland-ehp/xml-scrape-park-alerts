This will maintain similar usage consistent with Visitor Strategy limits.</p> <p>The 2026 hiking season is 1 March-31 December.

Signs, bunting and fences will mark these zones.

Visitors should carefully assess their swimming ability and stamina before entering the water.</li> <li><strong><em>Limited shade:</em></strong> Shade is currently limited on land and in the water. Plan your visit carefully &ndash; bring at least 2 litres of drinking water per person per day, and wear a hat, long-sleeved shirt and covered shoes. Carry a first-aid kit and aim to explore during the cooler parts of the day.</li> <li><em><strong>Remote location:</strong></em> Lawn Hill Gorge is remote, and Rangers may not always be available. Visitors must be self-sufficient, responsible for your own safety, and prepared for emergencies.</li> <li><em><strong>Emergency contacts:</strong></em> For emergencies, call Triple Zero (000). Consider carrying a satellite phone or personal locator beacon (PLB).</li> </ul> <p>The Boodjamulla Cooperative Management Council (i.e. the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and Waanyi People) thank the local community and stakeholders for their patience and support while work continues to safely restore and rebuild flood-damaged facilities and infrastructure.</p> <p>The southern sections of Boodjamulla National Park (Aboriginal Land)&mdash;Riversleigh D Site (part of the Australian Fossil Mammal Sites World Heritage Area) and Miyumba camping area&mdash;remain fully open for visitors.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",
