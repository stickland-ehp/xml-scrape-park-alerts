This will maintain similar usage consistent with Visitor Strategy limits.</p> <p>The 2026 hiking season is 1 March-31 December.

Keep to the hard sand well below the high tide line to avoid making wheel ruts that create barriers to hatchling movement down the beach.</li> <li>Avoid driving on the beach at night. This is when turtles will lay their eggs, and hatchlings are most likely to be emerging. Exercise caution and look out for turtles and turtle hatchlings when traversing on the beach.</li> <li>If turtles are making their way across the beach - slow down, stop and wait for the turtles to reach the ocean or the dunes.&nbsp;On-the-spot fines apply to visitors disturbing turtle hatchlings or turtle nests.</li> <li>Driving over vegetated dunes is dangerous and prohibited. It is damaging to the environment and can impact turtle nests, on-the-spot fines apply.</li> </ul> <p><strong>&lsquo;Cut the glow to help turtles go&rsquo;.</strong> Artificial lights can affect a turtle&rsquo;s ability to see the natural horizon over the ocean.

Keep to the hard sand well below the high tide line to avoid making wheel ruts that create barriers to hatchling movement down the beach.</li> <li>Avoid driving on the beach at night. This is when turtles will lay their eggs, and hatchlings are most likely to be emerging. Exercise caution and look out for turtles and turtle hatchlings when traversing on the beach.</li> <li>If turtles are making their way across the beach - slow down, stop and wait for the turtles to reach the ocean or the dunes. On-the-spot fines apply to visitors disturbing turtle hatchlings or turtle nests.</li> <li>Driving over vegetated dunes is dangerous and prohibited.

Based on the findings and recommendations from the geotechnical assessment, the camping area boundaries will be realigned to establish a 20-metre retrogression buffer<strong> </strong>zone landward of the current treeline.</p> <p>This boundary realignment is necessary due to ongoing coastal erosion, nearshore landslide risk, and damage sustained to existing infrastructure.

Entry and exit to Natone is now through the former exit.</li> <li>Caravans are not suitable in the M.V.

Open visitor facilities at Lawn Hill Gorge now include:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Constance Range walking track</li> <li>Duwadarri lookout walking track</li> <li>Lawn Hill Creek &ndash; for swimming and watercraft (one way in/one way out)</li> <li>Lawn Hill Gorge camping area - available to all campers <ul> <li>4 tent only sites</li> <li>14 &#39;multi-use&#39; sites (camper trailer, 4WD&nbsp;campervan, off-road caravan)</li> <li>1 commercial operator camp site</li> <li>Amenities (toilets open, no showers)</li> <li>Non-potable water (not drinking water).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Lawn Hill Creek - for swimming and watercraft (one way in/one way out).</li> </ul> <p><strong>For your safety</strong></p> <p>The flooding events have altered the look and feel of the gorge, but it remains a stunning and culturally significant place. While the area is regenerating, your safety is our top priority. Please note the following:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Construction zones:</em></strong>&nbsp;Some areas remain active construction sites and are closed to visitors. Signs, bunting and fences&nbsp;mark these zones. Please follow all signage and directions from Rangers or on-site personnel.</li> <li><strong><em>Daily temperatures are now reaching beyond the high 30 degree celcius, heatwave warnings have been issued and there&nbsp;is limited shade:</em></strong>&nbsp;Shade is currently limited on land and in the water. Plan your visit carefully &ndash; bring at least 2 litres of drinking water per person per day, and wear a hat, long-sleeved shirt and covered shoes. Carry a first-aid kit and aim to&nbsp;<strong>explore during the cooler parts of the day</strong>.</li> <li><strong><em>Watercraft and swimming areas:</em></strong>&nbsp;Entry to Lawn Hill Creek is one way in and one way out. You must exit from the same location you entered.</li> <li><strong><em>Swimming distances and fitness:</em></strong>&nbsp;There are no shaded areas or stopping points between the entry point to Lawn Hill Creek and Indarri Falls. Visitors should carefully assess their swimming ability and stamina before entering the water.</li> <li><strong><em>Remote location:</em></strong>&nbsp;Lawn Hill Gorge is remote, and Rangers may not always be available. Visitors must be self-sufficient, responsible for your own safety, and prepared for emergencies.</li> <li><strong><em>Emergency contacts:</em></strong>&nbsp;For emergencies, call Triple Zero (000). Consider carrying a satellite phone or personal locator beacon (PLB).</li> </ul> <p>The Boodjamulla Cooperative Management Council (i.e. the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and Waanyi People) thank the local community and stakeholders for their patience and support while work continues to safely restore and rebuild flood-damaged facilities and infrastructure.</p> <p>The southern sections of Boodjamulla National Park (Aboriginal Land)&mdash;Riversleigh D Site (part of the Australian Fossil Mammal Sites World Heritage Area) and Miyumba camping area&mdash;remain fully open for visitors.</p> <p><strong>NOTE: Continued monitoring of on-site conditions is occurring, and a park-wide wet season/summer closure will come into effect from Monday 15 December 2025. The closure will include all visitor facilities at both Lawn Hill Gorge and Riversleigh sections of the national park (Aboriginal Land).</strong></p>",
